# Createx

What if you could invest in the famous creator you know when he was nothing?
<br>
My idea originates from this, Createx is a platform which allows people to 'invest' in their favorite creators. The more you invest the more incentivized you get.
<br>
Like if you have invested:

- 1 matic - watch live streams (livepeer)
- 10 matic - do live chat(Push chat) with the creator
- 100 matic - do live video calling(huddle01)

<br>
There would be a nominal fees for registering yourself on the platform so that is not attacked by bots and generate revenue.
<br>
Uploaded videos by creators can be watched by all registered consumers but latest notifications(Push protocol) will be sent only to the channel members.
<br>
This idea struck my mind just 3 days ago(therefore not able to complete it) and have great plans on working even after the hackathon
