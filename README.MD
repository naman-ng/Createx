# Createx
"What if you could invest in MrBeast(popular youtube creator) 10 years ago when he was nothing"
My idea originates from this, Createx is a platform which allows people to 'invest' in their favorite creators. The more you invest the more incentivized you get. Like if you have invested:
1 matic - watch live streams (livepeer)  
10 matic - do live chat(Push chat) with the creator
100 matic - do live video calling(huddle01)
There would be a nominal fees for registering yourself on the platform so that is not attacked by bots and generate revenue.

Uploaded videos by creators can be watched by all registered consumers but latest notifications(Push protocol) will be sent only to the channel members.


This idea struck my mind just 3 days ago(therefore not able to complete it) and have great plans on working even after the hackathon
